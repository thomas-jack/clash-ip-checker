An intelligent automation tool for **Clash Verge** (and compatible cores) that automatically tests your proxy nodes, checks their IP purity/risk score via [IPPure](https://ippure.com/), and renames them with useful indicators (Bot Score, IP Risk, Native/Broadcast status).

> **Note**: This tool uses **Playwright** for accurate browser-based fingerprinting detection, ensuring the results match what a real user would see.

## ✨ Features

- **Auto-Switching**: Automatically cycles through your Clash proxies.
- **Deep IP Analysis**: Checks IP Pure Score, Bot Ratio, IP Attributes (Native/Data Center), and Source.
- **Smart Filtering**: Skips invalid nodes (e.g., "Expire Date", "Traffic Reset") automatically.
- **Config Injection**: Generates a new Clash Config (`_checked.yaml`) with emojis and stats appended to node names.
- **Global Mode Force**: Temporarily forces Clash into Global mode for accurate testing.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Clash Verge** (or any Clash client with External Controller enabled)
- **Playwright** (for browser automation)

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clash-automator.git
    cd clash-automator
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    playwright install chromium
    ```

3.  **Prepare a Config File**
    - Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` (Optional, or edit script directly for now).
    - Ensure your Clash External Controller is running (Default: `127.0.0.1:9097`).

## 🚀 Usage

1.  Open your Clash Client (e.g., Clash Verge).
2.  Enable **External Controller** in Settings.
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python clash_automator.py
    ```
4.  The script will:
    - Connect to Clash API.
    - Switch to "Global" mode.
    - Test each proxy one by one.
    - Generate a new file named `your_config_checked.yaml`.
5.  Import the new `_checked.yaml` into Clash to see the results!

## 📝 Output Example

Your proxy nodes will be renamed to provide instant visibility into their quality:

- `Old Name` -> `New Name 【🟢🔴 Native|ISP】`

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- |
| 🟢 | Low Risk (Good Pure Score) |
| 🔴 | High Bot Score (Bad) |
| Native | Native IP (Good for streaming) |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Currently, configuration is inside `clash_automator.py` (Refactor pending).
Look for the `CONFIGURATION` section at the top of the file:

```python
CLASH_CONFIG_PATH = r"path/to/your/profile.yaml"
CLASH_API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:9097"
CLASH_API_SECRET = ""
```
